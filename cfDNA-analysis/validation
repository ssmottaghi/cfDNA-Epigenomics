The obtained regions from the tissue ATAC-seq data were investigated based on the depth feature in real cfDNA samples related to healthy, kidney cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, and pancreas cancer.
The raw bam files were obtained from the : http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71378

The ID of the samples: IH01, IC39, IC13, IC15, IC37, and IC50

there are few features such as depth, fragment length, and entropy that were measured for the mentioned regions in the cfDNA bam files based.

for depth :
$ samtools bedcov all_regions.txt illumina/IC39.bam > all_in_kidney.csv

for fragment length and entropy the related python scripts are attached.
